Oyr JavaScript SDK greatly simplifies writing JavaScript applications that use HotRiot. While it's not required that you use our library in order to create your application, 
we strongly encourage that you do. It's sure to save you many hours of development and makes writing JavaScript applications with HotRiot a snap.

Simply include the two package below on your host HTML pages in the order they appear. We suggest you place them in the 'head' section of the page.
 
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/hots3sysbucketriot/hotriot_ajax_min.js"></script>

HotRiot is dependent on jQuery (version 7 or later). In the script code above, we're loading jQuery from the Google repository. Your free to load them however you think best.
